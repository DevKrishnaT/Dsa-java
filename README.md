DSA in Java

This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms practice using Java, along with continuous learning of core Java concepts.
It covers Java fundamentals and practical use of the Java Collections Framework, including List, Queue, and Map implementations. I’ve also explored synchronized collection variants to understand safe data handling, focusing on usage and behavior without diving into multithreading concepts yet.
In addition, I’m learning and applying Java 8 features, such as Streams, lambda expressions, and functional-style operations, to write cleaner and more expressive code while solving problems.
The repository reflects my focus on building strong DSA fundamentals, improving problem-solving skills, and maintaining clean, readable Java code. It is actively updated as I continue learning and revising concepts.
